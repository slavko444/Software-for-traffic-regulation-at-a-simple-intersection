# Software-for-traffic-regulation-at-a-simple-intersection


Exercise of Low Level Programming with 8086 Assembly Lecture, implemented with Emu8086.
In general, Emu8086 is easier to use, write code and test program.

**Subject**

Microcomputer's systems

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

- [e8085](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8085 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8085 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using e8085.exe:

1. Download and install e8085.exe from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open e8085.exe and load the `traffic_regulation.asm` file.
4. Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5. Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
